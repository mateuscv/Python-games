EN-US: This is an open-source little card game based in Gaucho/Spanish Truco, made in very limited time with very limited knowledge during the last few months of my first year in Computer Engineering graduation to be presented to the Algorithms I class. The contents are in Brazilian Portuguese and the game is mostly unpolished.

I have left the code as it's always been to preserve its original integrity. Anyone is free to add to it or modify the code, as long as the original credit is kept somewhere. :)
