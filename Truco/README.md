EN-US: This is an open-source little card game based in Gaucho/Spanish Truco, made in very limited time with very limited knowledge during the last few months of my first year in Computer Engineering graduation to be presented to the Algorithms I class. The contents are in Brazilian Portuguese and the game is very unpolished.

I have left the code as it's always been to preserve its original integrity. Anyone is free to add to it or modify the code, as long as the original credit is kept somewhere. :)

Per the license, I need to declare any changes made to his work. The image was cropped and the cards separated into standalone images, which were then put into the game.
